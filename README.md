# CypherShares UI

CypherShares is a new index protocol that offers the most comprehensive and liquid index products in crypto. Our initial index will be the CypherShares DeFi Index `(csDEFI)` and will hold at least 100 tokens of the best DeFi projects. CypherShares will use a novel Threshold Farming strategy in order to incentivise index liquidity.

We greatly encourage any community contribution that may help Index reach more users and greater adoption.
